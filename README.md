## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to install this project dependencies you need to install first the package manager conan.
You can use:

```
$ pip install conan

```

When Conan is installed with pip, usually a new directory is created for it. However, the directory is not appended automatically to the PATH and the conan commands do not work. This can usually be solved restarting the session of the terminal or running the following command:

```
$ source ~/.profile

```

On Windows you can use the Windows exe installer to set conan on your setup.
You can check the [conan official page FAQ](https://docs.conan.io/en/1.46/installation.html) for more help
